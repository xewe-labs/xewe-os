# AGENTS.md: xewe-os (firmware template)

Organization rules ([`.github/AGENTS.md`](https://github.com/xewe-labs/.github/blob/main/AGENTS.md))
win where this file is silent. Never run git write commands (commit, tag, push, init) or publish
unless the user asks.

## Running things

From the project root, after `./setup.sh`, always as `build/tools/.venv/bin/python -m xewe ...`
(the bare `xewe` script breaks when the project is moved; re-run `./setup.sh` then).

- Inspect first: `xewe build --chip c3 --dry-run` prints the arduino-cli command
  (works before the toolchain is installed once `build/tools/.venv` exists; in a fresh project run
  `./setup.sh` first).
- Build and test: `xewe build [--chip C | --all-chips]`, `xewe test [--unit-only] [--module SLUG]`.
  `-v` may go after the subcommand (`xewe test -v`). Project tests: `tests/board/` (pytest on the
  board) and `tests/unit/` (developer machine, `@pytest.mark.unit`); nothing else under `tests/`.
- Modules: `xewe modules list`, `xewe modules validate [PATH]`, `xewe modules select LIST|all|none`
  (edits `xewe.toml`: only when asked). Zero modules is a valid project.
- Libraries a module needs come from `libraries.toml` in the modules repo, installed by `./setup.sh`;
  a `[libraries]` pin in `xewe.toml` wins over it.
- Also safe: `xewe doctor`, `xewe manifest show`, `xewe boards --no-probe`.
- No board is normal (D22): `flash`, `run` and `test` exit 0 with
  `compiled, not run: no board attached (...)`; grep for that, it is not an error.
- Compile-only session: `export XEWE_NO_BOARD=1` first. No port is listed, probed or opened even
  if a board is plugged in; `test` still compiles, `flash`/`run`/`serial` exit 4.
- Do not pass `--require-board` or `--erase`, or flash a board, unless the user asks.
- Never run arduino-cli directly and never touch `~/.arduino15` or `~/Arduino`: the tools use an
  isolated toolchain in `~/.xewe-os/build-tools/` (shared by all projects; `XEWE_HOME` overrides
  `~/.xewe-os`). Never delete it as a fix; `xewe clean` never touches it.
- `--define` string values carry their own quotes: `--define 'PROJECT_URL="https://..."'`.

## Never commit

`build/`, `src/Modules.h`, venvs, editor files. The repo
holds only `xewe-os.ino`, `Config.h`, `xewe.toml`, `src/YourModule/` and `src/YourModuleFull/` (the
project-local example modules, minimal and full tour; rename or delete them), the scripts, docs and
`static/firmware/releases/` (written by `xewe release`).
The template's `xewe.toml` keeps `[modules] selected = []`: the selection is per project, chosen at
first setup (menu or `--modules`) and committed by the project, never by the template.

## Code rules

- The sketch includes `<XeWeCore.h>` (the umbrella). Including only `XeWeCore/<Part>.h` does not
  build: arduino-cli discovers libraries from top-level headers only.
- `Config.h` includes `<XeWeBuildInfo.h>` unconditionally. Never wrap it in `__has_include`.
- `XeWeOs os({...})` is declared before any module; `src/Modules.h` is included after it.
- Modules live in the modules repo (its `CONTRACT.md` and `AGENTS.md`): constructor Os parameter
  named `host` (member stays `os`), handlers capture `[this]` only, never write `cli(` (macro).
- Never edit `src/Modules.h` or `build/` by hand; they are regenerated.
- The version is `[project] version` in `xewe.toml`, never a literal in code.
