# RULES.md — root rules for agents in this project

Every rule below is absolute. It applies without exception, in every project that carries this
folder, and is never changed at install time or by an agent. Rules are cited by ID (`R-01` …
`R-15`) and are never renumbered. User-level rules live in `PREFERENCES.md` (R-15). If two
instructions conflict, R-03 decides.

## 1. Entry and Read Order

- **R-01 Read order.** On opening the project, read completely and in this order: `AGENTS.md`,
  `RULES.md`, `PREFERENCES.md`, `handoffs/HANDOFF.md` (through R-04), then the frontmatter of
  every `skills/*/SKILL.md`. Do no project work before all of these have been read.
- **R-02 Pickup before work.** The first action after reading is the `pickup` procedure of the
  `wax_handoff` skill. Restate the previous exit point to the human before touching anything
  else.
- **R-03 Precedence.** An explicit human instruction given in the current session outranks
  `RULES.md`, which outranks `PREFERENCES.md`, which outranks `AGENTS.md`, which outranks any
  individual skill. A preference never overrides a rule.
  Every human-instructed deviation is recorded in that session's handoff under "Design
  decisions", quoting the instruction.

## 2. Handoffs

- **R-04 Access only through `wax_handoff`.** Nothing under `handoffs/` is read, created,
  edited, moved, or deleted except by executing the `pickup` or `handoff` procedure of the
  `wax_handoff` skill. The exceptions belong to `wax_init`: filling the project name into the
  shipped genesis entry of a brand-new copy, and, during an upgrade, adding head keys that the
  current format requires to an existing `HANDOFF.md`. It never creates, edits, or removes an
  entry.
- **R-05 HEAD moves with the directory.** Writing an entry under `handoffs/handoffs/` and
  updating `handoffs/HANDOFF.md` are one operation. Never do one without the other.
- **R-06 Every session ends with a handoff.** A session that produced changes and no handoff
  is incomplete; say so to the human.
- **R-07 The template is copied, never filled in place.** `handoffs/handoffs/yyyy-mm-dd-hh-mm-ss.md`
  keeps its literal name and its placeholder content permanently.
- **R-08 Naming.** Entry filenames are UTC timestamps in the form `yyyy-mm-dd-hh-mm-ss.md`.
  HEAD is always the lexically greatest entry filename. Never backdate an entry.
- **R-09 Stop on inconsistency.** If `handoffs/HANDOFF.md` disagrees with the directory
  (HEAD, count, index, or a missing file), do not repair, do not write, do not guess. Report
  the exact mismatch to the human and wait.

## 3. Skills

- **R-10 Discover skills from their frontmatter.** A skill is a folder `skills/<name>/` that
  holds a `SKILL.md`. Skills are found by reading the `name` and `description` frontmatter of
  every `skills/*/SKILL.md`, the same way the host tool finds them. Nothing else indexes them.
- **R-11 Valid or nonexistent.** A folder under `skills/` whose `SKILL.md` is missing or fails
  R-12 is not a skill and must not be used. Adding or removing a skill is one change: the
  whole folder, with a valid `SKILL.md`.
- **R-12 Skill shape.** A skill is a folder containing `SKILL.md` whose YAML frontmatter has
  exactly two keys, `name` and `description`, and whose `name` equals the folder name.
  Supporting files sit flat beside `SKILL.md` or under `references/`, `scripts/`, `assets/`,
  or `evals/`.

## 4. Structure of `.agents/`

- **R-13 Fixed top level.** `.agents/` contains exactly `AGENTS.md`, `RULES.md`,
  `PREFERENCES.md`, `handoffs/`, and `skills/`, plus only the items listed in P-11. Never add,
  rename, or remove a top-level item.
- **R-14 Uppercase names are fixed.** `AGENTS.md`, `RULES.md`, `PREFERENCES.md`, `HANDOFF.md`,
  and every `SKILL.md` keep their names and locations.
- **R-15 Rules are root, preferences are user-level.** `RULES.md` is never edited by an agent
  or at install time. `PREFERENCES.md` ships with defaults; they are changed only during the
  `setup` procedure of `wax_init`, or later on an explicit human instruction quoted in that
  session's handoff. Preferences are cited by ID (`P-01` …) and bind exactly like rules until
  changed.

## 5. Project rules (xewe-os)

Added for this project on the owner's instruction; they bind like the rules above and are cited
as `X-NN`. They are not part of the WAX reference. They summarise the organization guidelines at
`https://github.com/xewe-labs/.github/tree/main/guidelines`, which are the source; where the two
differ, the guidelines win and this list is corrected.

- **X-01 Never commit generated files.** `build/` and `src/Modules.h` are never committed, nor
  venvs, caches or editor files. The repository holds `xewe-os.ino`, `Config.h`, `xewe.toml`,
  `src/YourModule/`, `src/YourModuleFull/`, `setup.sh`, `run.sh`, the docs, `.agents/` and
  `static/firmware/releases/` (written by `xewe release`). (guidelines/repositories.md)
- **X-02 Never edit generated files.** `build/**`, `src/Modules.h`, `<XeWeBuildInfo.h>` and
  `build_config.toml` are rewritten by the tools; change their source and regenerate.
- **X-03 `setup.sh` is the tools' script.** `setup.sh` is identical to `xewe-os-tools`
  `scripts/setup.sh` except its three header comment lines (name and purpose, usage, the
  "identical except" note); `run.sh` is identical to `scripts/run.sh`. A change goes to the tools
  first and is copied here.
- **X-04 The template ships no selection.** `xewe.toml` keeps `[modules] selected = []`: each
  project chooses its modules at first setup and commits that choice. Only `xewe modules select`,
  `setup --modules`, the first-setup menu, `manifest update` and `release` write `xewe.toml`, and
  only when asked.
- **X-05 Refs.** Core, modules and tools stay at `ref = "latest"` until the ecosystem's v3.0.0 tag
  set; then they move to tags with `xewe manifest update`, never by hand-editing a SHA.
- **X-06 The one include.** The sketch includes `<XeWeCore.h>`; `Config.h` includes
  `<XeWeBuildInfo.h>` unconditionally, never inside `__has_include`.
- **X-07 Examples teach and build.** `src/YourModule/` (minimal) and `src/YourModuleFull/` (every
  hook) compile against the current core with 0 warnings and follow the module contract
  (constructor parameter `host`, `[this]` captures, no `cli(`, ids ≤ 15 characters).
- **X-08 No process comments.** A comment says what the code does or why. No agent or session
  names, dates, decision or finding ids, "owner", run names, "was …" history, review or report
  references, in code, scripts, `xewe.toml` or the docs. History lives in the xewe-labs `docs/`.
  Source files keep their SPDX and path header lines (guidelines/license-header.txt).
- **X-09 Docs are part of the change.** A change to the first-boot flow, the commands, the layout
  or the examples updates `README.md` (and `ARCHITECTURE.md` when it changes a decision) in the
  same change.
- **X-10 Credentials.** Never open, print or copy a dotenv or key file; the tools read them.
